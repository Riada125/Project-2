# NOTTIFY ðŸŽ§


## Overview
[Check out Nottify here](https://mjadair.github.io/Nottify/)

My second project with General Assembly was a 48 hour 'hackathon' to build a multiple-page website using the React framework that consumes a public API. This was a pair programming task.

My partner, Sandor and 

## The Brief
The app should:

* **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.
